                    This paper identifies an important bias — termed <it>dynamic bias</it> — in fixed effects panel
                    estimators
                    that arises when dynamic feedback is ignored in the estimating equation. Dynamic feedback occurs if
                    past outcomes impact current outcomes, a feature of many settings ranging from economic growth to
                    agricultural and labor markets. When estimating equations omit past outcomes, dynamic bias can lead
                    to significantly inaccurate treatment effect estimates, even with randomly assigned treatments. This
                    dynamic bias in simulations is larger than Nickell bias. I show that dynamic bias stems from the
                    estimation of fixed effects, as their estimation generates confounding in the data. To recover
                    consistent treatment effects, I present a flexible estimator that provides fixed- T bias correction.
                    I apply this approach to study the impact of temperature shocks on GDP, a canonical outcome where
                    economic theory points to an important feedback from past to future outcomes. Accounting for dynamic
                    bias lowers the estimated effects of hotter years on GDP growth by 10% and GDP levels by 120%.

                    This paper introduces and proves asymptotic normality for a new semi-parametric estimator of
                    continuous treatment effects in panel data. Specifically, we estimate the average derivative. Our
                    estimator uses the panel structure of data to account for unob- servable time-invariant
                    heterogeneity and machine learning (ML) methods to preserve statistical power while modeling
                    high-dimensional relationships. We construct our estimator using tools from double de-biased machine
                    learning (DML) literature. Monte Carlo simulations in a nonlinear panel setting show that our method
                    estimates the average derivative with low bias and variance relative to other approaches. Lastly, we
                    use our estimator to measure the impact of extreme heat on United States (U.S.) corn production,
                    after flexibly controlling for precipitation and other weather features. Our approach yields extreme
                    heat effect estimates that are 50% larger than estimates using linear regression. This difference in
                    estimates corresponds to an additional $3.17 billion in annual damages by 2050 under median climate
                    scenarios. We also estimate a dose-response curve, which shows that damages from extreme heat
                    decline somewhat in counties with more extreme heat exposure.

                    Distinct risks are typically insured separately. A single `aggregate' contract that pays more when
                    many shocks occur simultaneously, but less when positive shocks offset negative shocks, is
                    utility-increasing absent moral hazard. However, an aggregate contract discourages diversification,
                    leading to a novel insurance-incentive trade-off. We study the US Federal Crop Insurance Program
                    (FCIP), where farmers can choose the `scope' of their policy - whether to insure each field
                    separately, or all fields of the crop as an aggregate unit. Starting in 2009, the FCIP introduced a
                    large subsidy increase for aggregate insurance. We show that farms that moved to aggregate insurance
                    reduced crop diversity and irrigation, farmed less and conserved more land, and insured price risk
                    --- all reducing the diversification of their risks. This increased the variability of farm yield by
                    14%, raising the fiscal cost of aggregate insurance by about $1.5 billion per year. We derive and
                    estimate a `Baily-Chetty'-style formula for the optimal contract scope. We find that an aggregate
                    policy is never welfare maximizing, but that the optimal policy lies partway between separate and
                    aggregate. More generally, we discuss scope's widespread relevance in insurance design.

                    Series and polynomial regression can approximate the same function classes as neural networks.
                    However, these methods are rarely used in practice, although they offer more interpretability than
                    neural networks. In this paper, we show that a potential reason for this is the slow convergence
                    rate of polynomial regression estimators and propose the use of bagged polynomial regression (BPR)
                    as an attractive alternative to neural networks. Theoretically, we derive new finite sample and
                    asymptotic L2 convergence rates for series estimators. We demonstrate that BPR performs as well as
                    neural networks in crop classification using satellite data, a setting where prediction accuracy is
                    critical, and interpretability is often required for addressing research questions.

                    In this paper, I introduce and prove the asymptotic normality of a novel nonparametric estimator for
                    continuous treatment effects. Continuous variables, such as environmental factors like temperature
                    and pollution levels, are frequently studied in economics and often require flexible modeling
                    approaches. I estimate points on the average dose-response function, which captures the expected
                    outcome at a specific level of the treatment variable. My approach integrates advanced techniques
                    from double debiased machine learning (DML) and automatic double machine learning (ADML) to
                    construct the estimator. A novel debiasing method enhances the theoretical stability and balancing
                    properties of the estimator. Simulations demonstrate that my estimator outperforms existing methods.

                    We propose a synthetic difference-in-difference estimator that incorporates time-varying covariates.
                    We incorporate covariates into a high-dimensional least squares with correlated error-in-variables
                    setting. We use results from this setting to derive conditions under which our synthetic
                    differences-in-differences estimator is asymptotically normal with estimable vari- ance. Monte Carlo
                    simulations demonstrate that our estimator outperforms classic synthetic difference-in-differences
                    in settings where covariates contain information about the outcome. We illustrate the practical
                    performance of our estimator by studying the impact of subsidy increases on crop insurance choices
                    within the United States Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP).

                    We study how childhood exposure to technology at ages 5-15 via the occupation of the parents affects
                    the ability to climb the social ladder in terms of income at ages 45-49 using the Danish micro data
                    from years 1961-2019. The challenge in estimating this effect is that long-term outcome is observed
                    over a different time horizon than our treatment of interest. We therefore adapt the surrogate index
                    methodology, linking the effect of our childhood treatment on intermediate surrogates, such as
                    income and education at ages 25-29, to the effect on adulthood income. We estimate that a one
                    standard error increase in exposure to technology increases the income rank by 2%-points, which is
                    economically and statistically significant and robust to cluster-correlation within families. The
                    derived policy recommendation is to update the educational curriculum to expose children to
                    computers to a higher degree, which may then act as a social leveler.
